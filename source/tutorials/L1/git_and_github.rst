Git and GitHub
--------------

The goal of this tutorial is to learn how to use `version control <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control>`__ with `Git <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)>`__ and storing your codes (privately) on `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__.

`Git <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)>`__ is a version control software that is used to track and store changes in your files (often source code for programs) without losing the history of past changes.
Files in Git are stored in a repository, which you can simply think of as a directory containing files (or other directories) related to a single 'project'. Git is widely used by professionals to keep track of what theyâ€™ve done and to collaborate with other people.

`GitHub <https://github.com/>`__ is a web based Git repository hosting service and social network.
It is the largest online storage space of collaborative works that exists in the world.
It is a place where you can share your code openly to the entire world or alternatively only to your collaborators working on the same project.
GitHub provides a nice web-interface to your files that is easy to use.
It is a nice way for exploring the codes and documentation or e.g., teaching materials such as those in our course.

Both Git and GitHub provide many more features than the ones mentioned here, but for now we are happy to understand the basic idea of what they are.
