1. Go to the **Dropbox** page at the course page
2. Submit  your **full name, GitHub username, and link to you GitHub repository** in the ``#week-1`` secion.

For example, ``Reza Safarzadeh, safarzadeh-reza, https://github.com/safarzadeh-reza/ENGO645``.
This will help us know you were able to create your account, that you have also figured out how to use GitHub, and we'll know who is who on GitHub :).

.. note::

    In case you're curious, we need your GitHub user name in order to access your assignment repositories in GitHub for grading and feedback.
