1. Ensure that you have access to the course's D2L (Desire2Learn) platform. If you encounter any issues accessing the platform despite being registered for the course, kindly reach out to the course instructor via email for assistance.
2. Visit the **Dropbox** page available on the course D2L website.
3. Submit  your **full name, GitHub username, and link to you GitHub profile** in the ``#week-1`` secion.

For example, ``Reza Safarzadeh, safarzadeh-reza, https://github.com/safarzadeh-reza``.

This will help us know you were able to create your account, that you have also figured out how to use GitHub, and we'll know who is who on GitHub :).
