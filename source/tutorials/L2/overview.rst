Overview
=========

This tutorial helps you with the data preparation and visualization using Python tools.

We will go through the foundational steps of data preparation and basics of data preprocessing using Python's Pandas library. 
We will also practice basic plotting with matplotlib library, to create meaningful visualizations and perform some exploratory data visualizations.
Moreover, we will learn how to use Folium library to visualize location-based data on maps, improving our skills in map analysis.

.. note::
    As mentioned in the first lecture of the course, this course requires basic knowledge of Python and Pandas library. 
    If you are not familiar with them, try catching up with the basics as fast as you can.
    Some useful resources are:

    - `Python for Data Analysis (3rd Edition, 2022) <https://wesmckinney.com/book/>`_.
    - `Pandas online documentation <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html>`_.
