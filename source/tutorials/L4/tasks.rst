.. admonition:: Start your assignment

    **You can start working on your copy of Assignment 3 by** `accepting the GitHub Classroom assignment <https://classroom.github.com/a/fwqjwSNd>`__.


- **Note that code versioning is important and contributes to your overall grade. We expect to see your versioning history, including commits and pushes to the GitHub repository. Remember, having only one commit may result in a deduction in your marks, so make sure to maintain a clear and organized versioning record.**
- **You don't have to submitt anything on D2L. Just push everything on the provided GitHub repository and that'a all!**



Start working
-------------

In this assignment you have to download your own case study to perform classification analysis. Before start coding, you should follow these steps:

1. **Access the Excel Sheet:** Access the provided Excel sheet containing the list of city names on OneDrive. You can find the link to the Excel sheet in the assignment instructions.

    Link to the excel sheet:

    Airbnb_city_names.xlsx
    `Airbnb_city_names.xlsx <https://uofc-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/reza_safarzadehramho_ucalgary_ca/Eczw2H55Y6RMu_-d6A2oKNUBJ62T-c3-xWi7LO4ZHaXx7A>`__

2. **Choose a City or Region:** Select a city or region of interest for your analysis. You can choose any city where Airbnb operates, or one that aligns with your research interests.

3. **Avoid Duplicate Selections:** Check the Excel sheet to ensure that no other student has already selected the same city. Avoid selecting a city that has already been chosen by another student to prevent duplicate selections.

4. **Download Airbnb Data:** Obtain the Airbnb dataset (in the form of ``listings.csv.gz``) for your chosen city from Inside Airbnb (`http://insideairbnb.com <http://insideairbnb.com>`__). The dataset should include information about Airbnb listings, including attributes such as property type, location, number of beds, and price.

5. Continue following the notebook and start coding your assignment!


.. admonition:: Use of AI-based tools

    Artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools using large language models (AI-LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, or DeepL, are changing the ways in which people produce content including software. 
    While AI-based tools can be useful for troubleshooting and gaining insights, it's crucial for your learning journey to understand the problems deeply and write the code independently. 
    These tools can be helpful for assistance and troubleshooting, but relying on them to generate entire code might hinder your understanding of the material.
    
    Remember, the goal is not just to get the correct solution but to comprehend the process and logic behind it. 
    You can only achieve this by writing the code yourself. Your growth comes from the effort you put into understanding and solving problems on your own.

    **So please use online resources for guidance and debugging, and feel free to ask questions, but refrain from using AI-based tools to generate code.**
