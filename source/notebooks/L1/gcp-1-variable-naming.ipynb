To say it differently, there are many ways to learn to program, and we want to help you learn how to program the right way!\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Not contain special characters. Python supports use of special characters by way of various encoding options that can be given in a program. That said, it is better to avoid variables such as ``lämpötila`` because encoding issues can arise in some cases. Better to stick to the [standard printable ASCII character set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters) to be safe.\n",
