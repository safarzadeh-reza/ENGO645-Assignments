    "# Plotting in with Pandas and Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll swiftly review the creation of various charts covered in our course lectures, including boxplots, histogram charts, barcharts, and more. While it's possible to generate simple plots directly from [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html) (you can practice for yourself), for finer control over multiple aspects of these plots, we'll explore the utilization of the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html) plotting module. Matplotlib stands out for its remarkable power and flexibility, as we'll demonstrate throughout this tutorial."

    "Python has many nice, useful libraries that can be used for plotting.\n",
    "some of the most popular are as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): matplotlib is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. matplotlib can be used in python scripts, the python and ipython shell, web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/): Plotly's Python graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs online. Examples of how to make line plots, scatter plots, area charts, bar charts, error bars, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, subplots, multiple-axes, polar charts, and bubble charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/): Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the style of D3.js, and to extend this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. [ggplot](http://ggplot.yhathq.com/): ggplot is a plotting system for Python based on R's ggplot2 and the Grammar of Graphics. It is built for making profressional looking, plots quickly with minimal code.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. [holoviews](http://holoviews.org/): HoloViews is an open-source Python library designed to make data analysis and visualization seamless and simple. With HoloViews, you can usually express what you want to do in very few lines of code, letting you focus on what you are trying to explore and convey, not on the process of plotting.\n"
