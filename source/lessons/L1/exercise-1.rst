Next, you will **let us know your GitHub username via Discord**.
Finally, you will **cook up some Python** using the skills you learned during the first lesson!

Part 1 - Sign up for GitHub

4. When prompted to select a plan, choose the free option.

Part 2 - Discord
----------------

*This part is only for registered students. We have sent an invite link to Discord to all registered participants before the first lesson.*
*Please contact the course instructors via email in case you are registered for the course, but don't have access to Discord.*

1. Go to our **Discord** page at https://discord.com/channels/1140629215608315964/1140629216082280470.
2. **Post a new message** in the ``#week-1`` channel with your **full name, GitHub username, course code** (GEOK3001 or GEOG-329-1).

For example, ``Dave Whipp, davewhipp, GEOK3001`` or ``Kamyar Hasanzadeh, kamyar68, GEOG-329-1`` (please use comma to separate the different parts).
This will help us know you were able to create your account, that you have also figured out how to use Discord, and we'll know who is who on GitHub :).

Students from other universities: you can add the name of your home institution (Aalto / Turku / Oulu) instead of the course code like this: ``Tua Nyl√©n, tuanylen, Turku``.

.. note::

    In case you're curious, we need your GitHub user name in order to access your exercise repositories in GitHub for grading and feedback.

.. admonition:: Start your assignment

    **You can start working on your copy of Exercise 1 by** `accepting the GitHub Classroom assignment <https://classroom.github.com/a/vwOAq8qb>`__.


1. Start the coding exercise by accepting the GitHub Classroom assignment (click on the link above).
2. Read the instructions from the repository.
3. Launch a new JupyterLab instance. *You can use Binder for this.*
4. Cook up some Python according to the instructions!  *Remember to save your work ;) !*
5. Download your solution, and upload it to GitHub.com into your personal Exercise 1 repository.

*This week, we upload the exercise manually to GitHub. Next week, you will learn how to pull and push the exercises directly from GitHub to Jupyter Lab using git!*

.. note::

    Each week, you will create a personal copy of the exercise repository on GitHub.com by clicking on the GitHub classroom link.

    You can also take a look at the template repository on GitHub: https://github.com/Geo-Python-2023/Exercise-1 .
    Note that you are only able to make changes in your personal repository generated via GitHub Classroom.

Summary (what to submit)
