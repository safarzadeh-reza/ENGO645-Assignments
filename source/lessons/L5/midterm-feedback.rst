Summary of mid-term course feedback
===================================

Is the pace of the lessons too fast, too slow, or about right?
--------------------------------------------------------------

*27 responses*

- In general, the pace is about right to slightly too fast
- Too much material is presented in individual lessons and maybe some could be cut to focus on the basics
- More time for some of the demos would be good
- It can be too fast sometimes, but rewatching with the lesson videos and pausing them helps

Is the content of the lessons too simple, too difficult, or about right?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

*27 responses*

- Seems to be about right for many
- Some more time to understand the concepts could be helpful
- Nice to work at the same time with the teacher
- More about principles and concepts would be Nice
- Students with earlier programming experience feel its a bit simple
- More examples would be helpful
- More time to learn about the course tools (GitHub, Slack, etc.) would be helpful
- Sometimes it feels like there is a bit too much material in the lessons
- Easier than the exercises

Is the content of the exercises too simple, too difficult, or about right?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*27 responses*

- Some new programmers feel they are pushing being too hard, others find them about right
- Too difficult to complete on my own
- Slack helps with getting answers to questions
- Maybe a bit too hard. I know what to do on some level, but the answers don't come to me.
- It might be nice to start with a 'warm up' exercise from the previous week before going into the new material
- Shorter and simpler problems (and maybe more of them) would be better
- Challenging, but not too challenging
- Way more difficult than the material in the lessons. I need help from others in the course to complete them.

Which aspect(s) of the course is/are most helpful to you?
---------------------------------------------------------

*27 responses*

- Website is good, but part of lesson on functions and variable names was not as good as the rest of the lessons
- Slack
- Lessons and optional readings
- Having an experienced programming partner :)
- Refreshing git practices and learning new tools (JupyterLab)
- Learning new Python tricks (e.g., f-strings)
- Good coding practices
- Lesson videos
- I did not like the idea of having a partner at first, but now I am enjoying it
- Exercises
- Teachers and course assistants
- How to use Python in GIS
- The way the course prepares for working with files in a scripted manner

Which aspect(s) of the course is/are least helpful to you?
----------------------------------------------------------

*21 responses*

- Lessons are a bit slow, I just use the website
- Exercises are too difficult
- Interactive part of the lessons. I just prefer to read the course page.
- Slack
- Online teaching
- Many new sites and tools
- The lessons
- Strict rules for the exercises, such as no copy/paste of the exercise cells
- The exercise groups
- The schedule for the course. It would be nice to be more flexible.
- Weeks when I am not the driver for the exercise

What suggestions do you have for improving this course? Comments related to online teaching would be especially useful!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*21 responses*

- Introducing the instructors with photos during the first lesson would be nice so you know what they look like for the exercise sessions
- Links to useful coding videos
- More repetition to help with learning. More easy examples in the lessons and additional easy problems in the exercises.
- More suggestions about alternative ways to do things in Python. If you already know this, you can read more about how to use something else at ...
- Course should require past Python experience in order to get into GIS operations more quickly
- Lessons and exercises could possibly be integrated more. Some tasks from the lessons could be left for the exercises as individual tasks with a 'final task' to do in pairs.
- Getting feedback more quickly on the exercises would be helpful
- Easier exercises!
- Human comments on the exercises
- Lessons could be longer, or in two parts
- More time in the lessons for doing the parts you should do on your own
- Automated grading could be available all the time for everyone
- Two breaks during the lessons
- Intro to GitHub could be slower
- Pacing of the lessons and exercise sessions could be more spread out so there is time after the lessons before the exercise sessions
- More exercises
