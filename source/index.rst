Welcome to Spatial Data Mining LAb 2024!
===========================

The **Spatial Data Mining** course teaches you the basic concepts of data mining and applications on working with spatial data, and in the course Lab you will be training to apply data mining techniques on spatial data using the Python programming language in a format that is easy to learn and understand.
Each exersice includes a tutorial with specific topic(s) where the aim is to gain skills and understanding how to solve common data-related tasks using Python.

.. .. admonition:: Open Access!

..     The course is **open for everyone to follow online**.
..     The aim of this course is to share the knowledge and help people to get started with their journey towards doing science more efficiently and in a reproducible manner using Python programming.

.. .. admonition:: University of Helsinki students

..     The Geo-Python course is run under two course codes in teaching period I at the University of Helsinki.
..     Please sign up using only one of these course codes (not both)!

..     - GEOG-329-1 for geography students
..     - GEOK3001 for geology students

Course format
-------------

The majority of this course will be spent in front of a computer learning to program in the Python language.
The course consists of interactive lectures and weekly exercises.
The exercises will focus on developing basic programming skills using Python and applying those skills to various analytical problems.
Typical exercises will involve a brief introduction followed by topical computer-based tasks.
For each exercise, you may be asked to submit the Python codes you have written, output figures and answers to related questions.
You are encouraged to discuss and work together with other students while working on the weekly exercises.
However, the exercises you submit must must clearly reflect your own work (in short, don't copy/paste from other students).

.. admonition:: On-site teaching

    Please note that the course is organized completely on site during the 2024 winter semester. However, lab sessions are combination on on site and online sessions.
    Online support will be available in the discussion board on course D2L or in online office hours.

Course topics
-------------

After completing this course, students will (1) understand basic programming concepts, (2) be able to write short programs, and (3) manipulate, analyze, and visualize scientific data using Python.
Students will also learn to use version control (git) and online repositories (GitHub) for documenting and sharing their work.
Themes for each week are listed below and will be completed during the semister.
